When we say that someone or something is “of note,” we are emphasizing their significance or fame12. For example, American writers of note include Herman Melville, Mark Twain, and Emily Dickinson. It’s a way to highlight the importance or distinction of a person, event, or thing. So, if you come across something “of note,” pay attention—it’s worth remembering! 😊
